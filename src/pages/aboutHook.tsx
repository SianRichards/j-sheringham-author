            As a scruffy teenager, Jo had no thoughts of writing until at school
            a short story competition deadline loomed. To avoid detention, she
            scrawled something out on scrap paper and forgot all about it. A
            surprise to everyone she did rather well, however she shelved any
            serious thoughts about writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years later, inspired by a dream and a popular song she blew away
            the cobwebs and challenged herself to complete a novel in a year.
            The writing flowed, and a story - My Detective Darling - emerged.
            Perhaps she could do this againâ€¦
          </p>
          <p>
            Jo loves a good tale and her writing is always informed by her
            faith. Essential to this process is a quiet space, a view of the
            sky, a hefty thesaurus and dictation software.
          </p>
